This is a repository of analyses for the PANGEA-HIV Phylodynamics Methods Comparison exercise. Datasets and instructions can be found [here](http://bit.ly/PANGEAHIVsim). The intention of this repository is to generate trees, evolutionary rates, *etc.*, so that more interesting things can be addressed in the (mere!) month for the first set of analyses to be completed.

* sequences: contains raw and processed sequence files
* raxmltrees: contains ML trees generated by RAxML
* lsd: contains clock-like trees generated by LSD
