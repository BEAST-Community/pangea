lsd
===

This directory contains trees generated by [LSD](http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/LSD/) v.0.1 from the RAxML trees in ```../raxmltrees```. The trees were forced to be binary via ```multi2di`` in the R library ```ape```. The command line for a treefile ```input.tre``` and a tipdate file ```input.txt```  for sequences ```x``` nucleotides long (6807 for the regional data, 6987 for the village data) is as follows.

```
lsd -i input.tre  -d input.txt -c -n 1 -r -b 10 -s x -v
```
